IP: ca. 40 billion combination possible -> we keep creating min-internet universes  

TCP : important that it arrives and we dont lose information.  
UDP communicaiton: doesn't care if it arrives. Video streaming and conference is classic example  

Port (on servers): virtual for a given task. Webserver (standard or secure), etc. Numbered, consensus what port to use for which service. 
80: HTTP
443: HTTPS

DNS servers: in hierarchies, roots know things (bottlenck), which DNS server might know more - playing around among rooters. You need to find the DNS that knows it and gives you the IP.  
Unnecessary if you know the IP address directly.  

Check a whole lot of stuff by Inspect and click network
Cookies: when connecting to website, it stores some information about you. Some are necessary to operate the website smoothly (basic cookies)

How HTTPS works?   
- No one is going to understand what happens between you and the server
- rather new standard
